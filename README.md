Trilo
-----------

Travel like a hacker!

About
=====

Trillo is a blog concept that has some new features, sort by country, by flag, and have a gragh detail of where have you been all this time. If you like traveling, and like hacking, why not traveling like a hacker?

Usage
=====
I'm working on it, so, by the moment, you can clone the repo and customize the structure.

Structure
=========
	
	/root
		/ES <- country
			index.html <- Contains 2 letter id for the country and a name.
			_posts
				YYYY-MM-DD-burgos.md <- City with some info like a title, days or recomended places.
		index.html <- Here you can customize some things (like your name, for example).
